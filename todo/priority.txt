- Load and unload maps in order not to have too many maps loaded in, like 
occlusion culling. This means that the relevant data of these maps needs to be 
kept, such as collected items, just not the map itself. And if all items have 
been collected, have a simple boolean or something to indicate it instead of 
remembering too many collectibles. Maybe the map can have an ID to be 
remembered by. And I vote for it to be three letters, the first of its name, 
and in all caps. For example, `some/path/dungeon.map` would be DUN. I already 
name my map with three characters anyway.
- Watch the new cat video, to see if there's something interesting for Olafur.
- Optimize the game as it is before adding any new feature. It's not normal to 
have such low FPS when Doom does more and yet runs on anything. Of course I'm 
not trying to be as optimized, but I should get something decent.
