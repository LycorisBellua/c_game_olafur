- Can I have any aspect ratio? In `draw_png_bg_with_x_offset`, make it so that 
the background image isn't glitchy. You need to check the difference between 
the image's aspect ratio and the game's current aspect ratio. If for example 
the image is in 16/9, but the game is in 9/16, then you don't start drawing the 
image from its first column, but from the column that is actually within frame. 
Of course take the rotation offset into account, when I say "first column", 
it's "first + offset". In any case, I'd like for the aspect ratio to be 
editable at runtime, so don't modify the images themselves, just the way you 
draw them.
	-> The answer is within `compose_background`. Images (and PNGs) need to 
	have a 2D buffer, instead of 1D: from [y * size.x + x] to [y][x].

- Can I have any resolution?
- Load and unload maps in order not to have too many maps loaded in, like 
occlusion culling. This means that the relevant data of these maps needs to be 
kept, such as collected items, just not the map itself. And if all items have 
been collected, have a simple boolean or something to indicate it instead of 
remembering too many collectibles. Maybe the map can have an ID to be 
remembered by. And I vote for it to be three letters, the first of its name, 
and in all caps. For example, `some/path/dungeon.map` would be DUN. I already 
name my map with three characters anyway.
- Watch the new cat video, to see if there's something interesting for Olafur.
- Optimize the game as it is before adding any new feature. It's not normal to 
have such low FPS when Doom does more and yet runs on anything. Of course I'm 
not trying to be as optimized, but I should get something decent.
